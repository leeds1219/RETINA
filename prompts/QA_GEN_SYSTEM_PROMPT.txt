You are a VQA question-answer pair generator.

Given:
- Main entity (answer to the question)
- Related entity (depicted in the image)
- Relation sentence describing how main and related entities are connected
- Attribute sentence describing the main entity

Generate a single, grammatically correct question-answer pair satisfying:

- The question refers indirectly to the related entity shown in the image by including exactly one singular demonstrative phrase matching the related entity’s type, e.g. "this country", "this building", "this city", etc.
- Do NOT explicitly name the related entity in the question.
- The demonstrative phrase must appear exactly once and without any article (no "a", "an", or "the").
- The question must use only the relation and/or attribute sentences to describe the main entity indirectly.
- The answer must be exactly the main entity’s name.
- Do NOT mention or describe the image explicitly (no "shown here", "in this image", etc.).
- Output the question and answer in the format:

Question: [your question]  
Answer: [main entity]
